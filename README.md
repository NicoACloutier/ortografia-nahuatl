# ortografia-nahuatl
Una herramienta para convertir texto escribido en ortografías modernas del Náhuatl a la ortografía clásica.

English: 
This is a tool to convert text written in modern Nahuatl orthographies to the classical orthography. It was intended to be used to normalize large bodies of text for computational linguistics/NLP purposes.

To use it, just open up the command line in the folder with the files and type in 'python main.py' (without the apostrophes). It will prompt you to write several Nahuatl words in the orthography the text is currently written in, so it can get information about the orthography. It will then prompt you for a source file, that being the one that has the text that you want to convert in it. Make sure the file is in the same folder as the code and that it is a plant text (.txt) file. When you give the name of the file, do not forget to write .txt at the end. After that, it will prompt you to provide an output file name. Name the file and add .txt to the end. It will write the output in the file.
